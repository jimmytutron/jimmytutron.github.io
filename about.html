    <p>Hello! My name is Jimmy, and I'm a Frontend Developer and Web Designer. I began honing my design skills by tinkering with Photoshop and creating custom layouts back when Xanga and Myspace were still popular. (We miss you, Tom!) Since then, I've expanded my graphic design prowess after earning my Bachelor of Arts degree at California State University East Bay. While pursuing my degree, I was introduced to web development, which I thoroughly enjoyed (and was quite skilled at, if I may say so myself). This led me to pursue web development as a full-time career.</p>
    <p>After completing the UC Berkeley Extension Bootcamp, I continued as a co-instructor before joining Gap Inc., where I worked as a Frontend Developer for their startup men's athleisure brand, Hill City. (HILL CITY FOREVER!) When the pandemic hit, I transitioned to Banana Republic, where I played a key role in the brand's web redesign, implementing features and components that are still in use today. My journey in development is ongoing, and I am continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skills. I am currently seeking my next opportunity!</p>
    <p>In my free time, I love to travel and explore new cuisines. I'm an aviation enthusiast and can probably name every airline and aircraft type. I also enjoy listening to a wide range of music, playing video games, and spending time with my dogs, Yuki and Benji. I consider myself a TV and movie buff, having watched nearly everything available on streaming services and in theaters. Below you can find what I'm currently up to, follow me on Twitter and linkedIn to learn more!</p>
