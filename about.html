    <p>At the age of 11, when all web wizards are called upon to begin their training, I began honing my magical prowess with design potions on Xanga and Myspace. Since then, I have expanded my knowledge of the graphic arts after completing several courses such as Defense Against Bad Kerning at California State University East Bay, earning myself an honorary degree. Currently, I practice my craft as one of the main illusionists at OneHallyu.com and have futher honed my skills at UC Berkeley Extension - Coding Bootcamp.</p>
    <p>At the Bootcamp, I concoted new spells and potions related to the powerful tools of Full stack web development. One spell in particular, javascript, is quite potent and versatile. I have been able to conjure up a multitude of applications by mixing a plethora of design potions and javascript spells. There are libraries full of tools and secrets litered throughout the internet and I'm anxious and curious to learn as much as I can.</p>
    <p>My specialty skill not related to the wizarding worldwide web, is a mastery of Netflix Binging. I once watched all 7 seasons of <span class="font-italic">Parks and Recreation</span> over a span of 5 days. Impressive, I know. A good wizard is well cultured and partakes in muggle (that's non-magical folk) activities. As such, I enjoy listening to mainstream pop music and playing video games. Currently I'm off adventuring in <span class="font-italic">The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild</span> and pushing payloads in <span class="font-italic">Overwatch.</span></p>
    <p>In the winter time you can find me queuing in line for the Forbidden Journey at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter or frolicking around Disneyland.</p>
