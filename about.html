    <p>Hello! My name is Jimmy and I'm a Frontend Developer and Web Designer. I began honing my design skills tinkering with photoshop and making custom layouts way back when Xanga and Myspace were still a thing. (We miss you Tom) Since then, I have expanded my graphic design prowress after completing my Bacherlors of Art at California State University East Bay. While studying for my degree, I was exposed to web development, which I thorougly enjoyed (and was pretty good at, not to toot my own horn) which I later decided to pursue full time.</p>
    <p>After completing the UC Berkeley Extension Bootcamp, I stayed on as co-instructor before landing at Gap Inc. working as a frontend developer for their then startup Men's athleisure brand, Hill City. When the pandemic hit, I was moved over to Banana Republic where I was at the forefront of the brand's web redesign and implemented key features and components still used on the site today. My development journey never ends and I'm currently learning new technologies to bolster my skills and I'm currently looking for my next opportunity!</p>
    <p>In my free time, I love to travel and eat new foods. I consider myself an aviation enthusiast and can probably name every airline and aircraft type. I also enjoy listening to a plethora of music genres, playing video games and spending time with my dogs Yuki and Benji. I consider myself a TV and movie buff, having watched probably almost everything on streaming services and in theaters currently. Get to know me better and let's connect on LinkedIn!</p>
